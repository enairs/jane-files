Dear Ma’am Lucagbo:

Greetings!
To be able to acquire professional experience in the banking industry I, Jane Irish Ayop, would like to express my interest in being part of your company as an intern in positions that are available. 
As a third year in English Language Studies at Central Mindanao University, I have acquired various skills such as analytical reading, customer service, information literacy, and research skills. Although I may not have any work or other internship experiences, I'm diligent, determined, and most especially, meticulous with my studies. Despite being amid a pandemic, I have been a constant dean's lister, currently with a GWA of 1.64 whilst also having to man our small family business.
While in the AB English Language Studies program, we have focused our coursework on the following areas:
•	English for employment across professions (mainly in customer service)
•	English language testing and assessment
•	Research Methods
•	Foreign Languages
•	Approaches and Foundations to College English Teaching
Considering the fact that the EON group won silver at Campaign Asia's Philippines PR Agency of the Year 2021, it really would be a great honor to be a part of your program. I believe that with your internship program, you will hone my existing skills and bring the best out of me. With that, I have enclosed my curriculum vitae for your review.
I am looking forward to our future cooperation. I appreciate your time and consideration.

Sincerely,


AYOP, JANE IRISH E.
 BAELS student intern
